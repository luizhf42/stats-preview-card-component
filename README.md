## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Atomic Design Methodology

### What I learned

I reinforced the use of media queries and flexbox, that are "new" to me, and also tried to use the atomic design method.

### Continued development

I will continue practicing development with CSS in general and, maybe, start with mobile-first workflow.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - This helped me in the effect of the image.
